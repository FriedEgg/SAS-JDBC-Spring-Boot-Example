# Example of Using SAS JDBC Driver with Spring Boot

## Overview
This application creates a very simple command line application using 
Spring Boot which reads data from the SAS table SASHELP.IRIS and prints
it to the console.

## SAS MVADriver for JDBC Information
The SAS MVADriver for JDBC uses the SAS Integration Technologies IOM 
driver to provide access to Base SAS data via a SAS Workspace Server.  
If you have licensed one or more SAS/ACCESS engines, you can also use 
the IOM driver to access third-party relational data.
